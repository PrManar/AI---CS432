This repository contains my implementations of classical search algorithms studied in an Artificial Intelligence course, along with a final project that demonstrates building and visualizing a search tree.

📂 Repository Contents

🔹 Java Implementations

The following uninformed search algorithms are implemented in Java:

DFS (Depth-First Search)
BFS (Breadth-First Search)
IDS (Iterative Deepening Search)
DLS

Each algorithm follows the standard AI search principles and demonstrates how states are explored and expanded.

🔹 Final Project (Python)

The final project is implemented in Python and focuses on:

Building a search tree
Expanding nodes based on search logic
Demonstrating how different paths are explored

⚙️ Technologies Used

Java – for core search algorithm implementations
Python – for the final search tree project

🎯 Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I learned how to:

Implement classical AI search algorithms
Compare different search strategies
Build and analyze search trees.

🌱 Future Improvements

Add visualization for search trees
Compare time & space complexity
